## FamiStudio Note Lookup Tables

This directory will contain the period lookup tables for the FamiStudio
sound engine. These are generated by FamiStudio when exporting music and
define the pitch values for each note on the 2A03 sound channels.

Tables will be added when the real FamiStudio engine replaces the stub.
